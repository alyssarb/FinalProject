# Plots

1. *GCplot.jpeg* is a plot of the sequence GC% distribution
1. *freq LOG distribution of all seq sizes.jpeg* is a distribution plot of all size sequences (log scale)
1. *freq LOG distribution of small seqs.jpeg* is a distribution plot of sequences smaller than 100kb (log scale)
1. *freq distribution of small seqs.jpeg* is a distribution plot of sequences smaller than 100kb (linear scale)
1. *histo distribution of large seqs.jpeg* is a plot of sequences that are over 100kb
1. *histogram exon length.jpeg* is a plot of the length of exons
1. *histogram gene length.jpeg* is a plot of the length of genes
1. *histogram transcripts per gene.jpeg* is a plot of the number of transcripts per gene
